title:  "Docker + Polymer = A New Way to Build Modular Cloud Apps"
biography: |+
    I lead a team in London focused on providing high quality sample apps, libraries, tools, and educational resources to help developers get the most out of Google's developer products. My team's current areas of concentration are Android libraries, Web components, and Web Developer tools.

    I have a strong interest in cloud computing and I'm currently collaborating with Kathryn Hurley and Paul Newson on an O'Reilly book about Google Compute Engine (http://bit.ly/gce-book).

    In a previous life, I helped design and build communication systems at Bell Labs and Lucent Technologies. When I'm not working, I enjoy indie music and films, writing, teaching, and chess.

Web components solve a number of shortcomings in web development by bringing a world of improved reusability, encapsulation and extensibility to how developers build apps today. Polymer is a library that uses web components, and adds two-way data binding, declarative event handlers, property observation, gesture support, and other features to help you build powerful, reusable elements. 

The power of Polymer, the modularity of Docker, and the scalability of the cloud combine to offer a new approach to building web applications. This talk will feature an overview of Polymer, along with code snippets and demos showing how this technology can be used to orchestrate Docker container deployment in the Google Cloud Platform.
