title:  "Build and deploy your own database with Node.js, LevelDB and Docker"
biography: |+
    I’m a software engineer with a passion for coding, distributed architecture and agile methodologies. I’ve worked with a wide range of technologies (Java, Ruby, Javascript, Node.js, Objective-C) applying them to various fields.

    Since 2011 I'm involved in the italian startup community, for which I've built fb.group2me.com, a tool to connect Facebook Groups and Twitter accounts, and I've used it to power the @itstartupscene twitter account.
    In my spare time, I build and contribute to open source software that I release on my github profile.

We are slaves of our databases, our applications are built around the data models that those give us.
The most beautiful abstract was SQL, and then NoSQL improved how we build our apps using simpler abstractions. Still, we application developers depend on those abstractions. In this talk I will first present how to build your own abstractions and data models using Node.js and LevelDB, with its amazing binding LevelUp! Then I will present how to deploy such a system, and how docker is the perfect tool for the job!
